[ edit ] creating the project begin by launching xcode and creating a new ios single view application iphone project with a product name and class prefix of pageapp , making sure that the use storyboard option is not selected. [ edit ] adding the content view controller the example application will use instances of a single view controller class to display pages to the user. the view will contain a uiwebview object onto which different html content will be displayed depending on the currently selected page. the view controller class will also need a data object property that will be used to hold the html content for the view. to add the content view controller, select the xcode file -> new -> new file… menu option and create a new uiviewcontroller class named contentviewcontroller and including an xib file. select the contentviewcontroller.h file and add an outlet to the web view component and a reference to the data object: #import <uikit/uikit.h> @interface contentviewcontroller : uiviewcontroller @property (strong, nonatomic) iboutlet uiwebview *webview; @property (strong, nonatomic) id dataobject; @end next, select the contentviewcontroller.xib file and drag and drop a uiwebview component from the object library to the view canvas: figure 20-1 ctrl-click over the file’s owner object, drag the connection line to the web view object and select the webview outlet from the resulting menu. with the user interface designed, select the contentviewcontroller.m file. each time the user turns a page in the application, the data source methods for a uipageviewcontroller object are going to create a new instance of our contentviewcontroller class and set the dataobject property of that instance to the html that is to be displayed on the web view object. as such, the viewwillappear method of contentviewcontroller needs to assign the value stored in the dataobject property to the web view object. to achieve this behavior, add the appropriate @synthesize directive to the file and add the viewwillappear method to assign the html to the web view: #import \"contentviewcontroller.h\" @implementation contentviewcontroller @synthesize webview, dataobject; . . - (void)viewwillappear:(bool)animated { [super viewwillappear:animated]; [webview loadhtmlstring:dataobject baseurl:[nsurl urlwithstring:@\"\"]]; } . . @end at this point work on the content view controller is complete. the next step is create the data model for the application. [ edit ] creating data model the data model for the application is going to consist of an array object containing a number of string objects, each configured to contain slightly different html content. for the purposes of this example, the data source for the uipageviewcontroller instance will be the application’s pageappviewcontroller class. this class will, therefore, need references to an nsarray and a uipageviewcontroller object. it will also be necessary to declare this class as implementing the uipageviewcontrollerdatasource protocol. select the pageappviewcontroller.h file and add these references as follows together with an import directive for the contentviewcontroller.h file: #import <uikit/uikit.h> #import “contentviewcontroller.h” @interface pageappviewcontroller : uiviewcontroller <uipageviewcontrollerdatasource> { uipageviewcontroller *pagecontroller; nsarray *pagecontent; } @property (strong, nonatomic) uipageviewcontroller *pagecontroller; @property (strong, nonatomic) nsarray *pagecontent; @end the final step in creating the model is to add a method to the pageappviewcontroller.m file to add the html strings to the array and then call that method from viewdidload: (note also the addition of the @synthesize directive): #import \"pageappviewcontroller.h\" @implementation pageappviewcontroller @synthesize pagecontroller, pagecontent; . . - (void) createcontentpages { nsmutablearray *pagestrings = [[nsmutablearray alloc] init]; for (int i = 1; i < 11; i++) { nsstring *contentstring = [[nsstring alloc] initwithformat:@\"<html><head></head><body><h1>chapter %d</h1><p>this is the page %d of content displayed using uipageviewcontroller in ios 5.</p></body></html>\", i, i]; [pagestrings addobject:contentstring]; } pagecontent = [[nsarray alloc] initwitharray:pagestrings]; } . . - (void)viewdidload { [super viewdidload]; [self createcontentpages]; } the application now has a content view controller and a data model from which the content of each page will be extracted by the data source methods. the next logical step, therefore, is to implement those data source methods. as previously outlined in implementing a page based ios 5 iphone application using uipageviewcontroller , instances of the uipageviewcontroller class need a data source. this takes the form of two methods, one of which is required to return the view controller to be displayed after the currently displayed view controller, and the other the view controller to be displayed before the current view controller. since the pageappviewcontroller is going to act as the data source for the page view controller object, these two methods, together with two convenience methods (which we will borrow from the xcode page-based application template) will need to be added to the pageappviewcontoller.m file. begin by adding the two convenience functions: #import \"pageappviewcontroller.h\" @implementation pageappviewcontroller @synthesize pagecontroller, pagecontent; - (contentviewcontroller *)viewcontrolleratindex:(nsuinteger)index { // return the data view controller for the given index. if (([self.pagecontent count] == 0) || (index >= [self.pagecontent count])) { return nil; } // create a new view controller and pass suitable data. contentviewcontroller *dataviewcontroller = [[contentviewcontroller alloc] initwithnibname:@\"contentviewcontroller\" bundle:nil]; dataviewcontroller.dataobject = [self.pagecontent objectatindex:index]; return dataviewcontroller; } - (nsuinteger)indexofviewcontroller:(contentviewcontroller *)viewcontroller { return [self.pagecontent indexofobject:viewcontroller.dataobject]; } . . @end the viewcontrolleratindex: method begins by checking to see if the page being requested is outside the bounds of available pages by checking if the index reference is zero (the user cannot page back beyond the first page) or greater than the number of items in the pagecontent array. in the event that the index value is valid, a new instance of the contentviewcontroller class is created and the dataobject property set to the contents of the corresponding item in the pagecontent array of html strings. the indexofviewcontroller method is passed a viewcontroller object and is expected to return the index value of the controller. it does this by extracting the dataobject property of the view controller and finding the index of the matching element in the pagecontent array. all that remains to be implemented as far as the data source is concerned are the two data source protocol methods which, in turn, make use of the two convenience methods to return the view controllers before and after the current view controller: - (uiviewcontroller *)pageviewcontroller: (uipageviewcontroller *)pageviewcontroller viewcontrollerbeforeviewcontroller: (uiviewcontroller *)viewcontroller { nsuinteger index = [self indexofviewcontroller: (contentviewcontroller *)viewcontroller]; if ((index == 0) || (index == nsnotfound)) { return nil; } index--; return [self viewcontrolleratindex:index]; } - (uiviewcontroller *)pageviewcontroller: (uipageviewcontroller *)pageviewcontroller viewcontrollerafterviewcontroller:(uiviewcontroller *)viewcontroller { nsuinteger index = [self indexofviewcontroller: (contentviewcontroller *)viewcontroller]; if (index == nsnotfound) { return nil; } index++; if (index == [self.pagecontent count]) { return nil; } return [self viewcontrolleratindex:index]; } with the data source implemented, the next step is to create and initialize an instance of the uipageviewcontroller class. [ edit ] initializing the uipageviewcontroller all that remains is to create the uipageviewcontroller instance and initialize it appropriately. since this needs to be performed only once per application invocation a suitable location for this code is the viewdidload: method of the pageappviewcontroller class. select the pageappviewcontroller.m file and modify the viewdidload method so that it reads as follows: - (void)viewdidload { [super viewdidload]; [self createcontentpages]; nsdictionary *options = [nsdictionary dictionarywithobject: [nsnumber numberwithinteger:uipageviewcontrollerspinelocationmin] forkey: uipageviewcontrolleroptionspinelocationkey]; self.pagecontroller = [[uipageviewcontroller alloc] initwithtransitionstyle:uipageviewcontrollertransitionstylepagecurl navigationorientation:uipageviewcontrollernavigationorientationhorizontal options: options]; pagecontroller.datasource = self; [[pagecontroller view] setframe:[[self view] bounds]]; contentviewcontroller *initialviewcontroller = [self viewcontrolleratindex:0]; nsarray *viewcontrollers = [nsarray arraywithobject:initialviewcontroller]; [pagecontroller setviewcontrollers:viewcontrollers direction:uipageviewcontrollernavigationdirectionforward animated:no completion:nil]; [self addchildviewcontroller:pagecontroller]; [[self view] addsubview:[pagecontroller view]]; [pagecontroller didmovetoparentviewcontroller:self]; } all the code for the application is now complete. before compiling and running the application some time needs to taken to deconstruct and analyze the code in the viewdidload: method. after constructing the data model with the call to the createcontentpage: method an nsdictionary object is created to contain the options that will be applied to the page controller object. in this instance the only option used is to set the spine location to appear on the left of the screen: nsdictionary *options = [nsdictionary dictionarywithobject: [nsnumber numberwithinteger:uipageviewcontrollerspinelocationmin] forkey: uipageviewcontrolleroptionspinelocationkey]; next, an instance of the uipageviewcontroller class is created using the previously created options object and specifying horizontal navigation orientation: self.pagecontroller = [[uipageviewcontroller alloc] initwithtransitionstyle:uipageviewcontrollertransitionstylepagecurl navigationorientation:uipageviewcontrollernavigationorientationhorizontal options: options]; since the current class is going to act as the data source for the page controller this also needs to be configured. we also want the pages to fill the entire screen, so need to set the bounds appropriately: pagecontroller.datasource = self; [[pagecontroller view] setframe:[[self view] bounds]]; before the first page can be displayed a view controller must first be created. this can be achieved by calling our viewcontrolleratindex: convenience method. once a content view controller has been returned it needs to be assigned to an array object: contentviewcontroller *initialviewcontroller = [self viewcontrolleratindex:0]; nsarray *viewcontrollers = [nsarray arraywithobject:initialviewcontroller]; note that only one content view controller is needed because the page controller is configured to display only one, single sided page at a time. had the page controller been configured for two pages (with a mid location spine) or for double sided pages it would have been necessary to create content view controllers at this point and assign both to the array. with an array containing the content view controller ready, the array needs to be assigned to the view controller with the navigation direction set to forward mode: [pagecontroller setviewcontrollers:viewcontrollers direction:uipageviewcontrollernavigationdirectionforward animated:no completion:nil]; finally, the standard steps need to be taken to add the page view controller to the current view: [self addchildviewcontroller:pagecontroller]; [[self view] addsubview:[pagecontroller view]]; [pagecontroller didmovetoparentviewcontroller:self]; [ edit ] running the uipageviewcontroller application click on the run button to compile and launch the application in the ios iphone simulator. once loaded the first content page should appear. a right to left gesture motion on the screen will cause the page to transition to the second page of content and reversing the gesture direction will page backwards: @import \"/extensions/googleadsense/googleadsense.css\";

{"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter","title":"Savitzky–Golay filter - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","text":" savitzky–golay filter from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia jump to: navigation , search animation showing smoothing being applied, passing through the data from left to right. the red line represent the local polynomial being used to fit a sub-set of the data. the smoothed values are shown as circles. a savitzky–golay filter is a digital filter that can be applied to a set of digital data points for the purpose of smoothing the data, that is, to increase the signal-to-noise ratio without greatly distorting the signal. this is achieved, in a process known as convolution , by fitting successive sub-sets of adjacent data points with a low-degree polynomial by the method of linear least squares . when the data points are equally spaced an analytical solution to the least-squares equations can be found, in the form of a single set of \"convolution coefficients\" that can be applied to all data sub-sets, to give estimates of the smoothed signal, (or derivatives of the smoothed signal) at the central point of each sub-set. the method, based on established mathematical procedures, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] was popularized by abraham savitzky and marcel j. e. golay who published tables of convolution coefficients for various polynomials and sub-set sizes in 1964. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] some errors in the tables have been corrected. [ 5 ] the method has been extended for the treatment of 2- and 3-dimensional data. savitzky and golay's paper is one of the most widely cited papers in the journal analytical chemistry [ 6 ] and is classed by that journal as one of its \"10 seminal papers\" saying \"it can be argued that the dawn of the computer-controlled analytical instrument can be traced to this article\". [ 7 ] contents 1 applications 1.1 moving average 2 derivation of convolution coefficients 2.1 algebraic expressions 2.2 use of orthogonal polynomials 2.3 treatment of first and last points 2.4 weighting the data 3 two-dimensional convolution coefficients 4 some properties of convolution 4.1 signal distortion and noise reduction 4.1.1 multipass filters 4.2 frequency characteristics of convolution filters 4.3 convolution and correlation 4.3.1 multipass filters 5 see also 6 appendix 6.1 tables of selected convolution coefficients 7 notes 8 references 9 external links applications [ edit ] the data consists of a set of n { x j , y j } points ( j = 1, ..., n ), where x is an independent variable and y j is an observed value. they are treated with a set of m convolution coefficients, c i according to the expression it is easy to apply this formula in a spreadsheet . selected convolution coefficients are shown in the tables, below . for example, for smoothing by a 5-point quadratic polynomial, m = 5, i = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2 and the j th smoothed data point, y j , is given by , where, c −2 = −3/35, c −1 = 12 / 35, etc. there are numerous applications of smoothing, which is performed primarily to make the data appear to be less noisy than it really is. the following are applications of numerical differentiation of data. [ 8 ] (1) synthetic lorentzian + noise (blue) and 1st. derivative (green) (2) titration curve (blue) for malonic acid and 2nd. derivative (green). the part in the light blue box is magnified 10 times (3) lorentzian on exponential baseline (blue) and 2nd. derivative (green) (4) sum of two lorentzians (blue) and 2nd. derivative (green) (5) 4th. derivative of the sum of two lorentzians location of maxima and minima in experimental data curves. this was the application that first motivated savitzky. [ 4 ] the first derivative of a function is zero at a maximum or minimum. the diagram shows data points belonging to a synthetic lorentzian curve, with added noise (blue diamonds). data are plotted on a scale of half width, relative to the peak maximum at zero. the smoothed curve (red line) and 1st. derivative (green) were calculated with 7-point cubic savitzky–golay filters. linear interpolation of the first derivative values at positions either side of the zero-crossing gives the position of the peak maximum. 3rd. derivatives can also be used for this purpose. location of an end-point in a titration curve . an end-point is an inflection point where the second derivative of the function is zero. [ 9 ] the titration curve for malonic acid illustrates the power of the method. the first end-point at 4 ml is barely visible, but the second derivative allows its value to be easily determined by linear interpolation to find the zero crossing. baseline flattening. in analytical chemistry it is sometimes necessary to measure the height of an absorption band against a curved baseline. [ 10 ] because the curvature of the baseline is much less than the curvature of the absorption band, the second derivative effectively flattens the baseline. three measures of the derivative height, which is proportional to the absorption band height, are the \"peak-to-valley\" distances h1 and h2, and the height from baseline, h3. [ 11 ] resolution enhancement in spectroscopy. bands in the second derivative of a spectroscopic curve are narrower than the bands in the spectrum: they have reduced half-width . this allows partially overlapping bands to be \"resolved\" into separate (negative) peaks. [ 12 ] the diagram illustrates how this may be used also for chemical analysis , using measurement of \"peak-to-valley\" distances. in this case the valleys are a property of the 2nd. derivative of a lorentzian. ( x -axis position is relative to the position of the peak maximum on a scale of half width at half height ). resolution enhancement with 4th. derivative (positive peaks). the minima are a property of the 4th derivative of a lorentzian. moving average [ edit ] main article: moving average a moving average filter is commonly used with time series data to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends or cycles. it is often used in technical analysis of financial data, like stock prices, returns or trading volumes. it is also used in economics to examine gross domestic product, employment or other macroeconomic time series. an unweighted moving average filter is the simplest convolution filter. each subset of the data set is fitted by a straight line. it was not included in the savitzsky-golay tables of convolution coefficients as all the coefficient values are simply equal to 1/ m . derivation of convolution coefficients [ edit ] when the data points are equally spaced an analytical solution to the least-squares equations can be found. [ 2 ] this solution forms the basis of the convolution method of numerical smoothing and differentiation. suppose that the data consists of a set of n { x j , y j } points ( j = 1, ..., n ), where x is an independent variable and y j is a datum value. a polynomial will be fitted by linear least squares to a set of m (an odd number) adjacent data points, each separated by an interval h . firstly, a change of variable is made where is the value of the central point. z takes the values (e.g. m = 5 → z = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2). [ note 1 ] the polynomial, of degree k is defined as [ note 2 ] the coefficients a 0 , a 1 etc. are obtained by solving the normal equations where the i th row of the jacobian matrix , , has values 1, z i , z i 2 , .. . for example, for a cubic polynomial fitted to 5 points, z = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2 the normal equations are solved as follows. now, the normal equations can be factored into two separate sets of equations, by rearranging rows and columns, with expressions for the inverse of each of these matrices can be obtained using cramer's rule the normal equations become and multiplying out and removing common factors, the coefficients of y in these expressions are known as convolution coefficients. they are elements of the matrix in general, in matrix notation this example is written as tables of convolution coefficients, calculated in the same way for m up to 25, were published for the savitzky–golay smoothing filter in 1964, [ 3 ] [ 5 ] the value of the central point, z = 0, is obtained from a single set of coefficients, a 0 for smoothing, a 1 for 1st. derivative etc. the numerical derivatives are obtained by differentiating y. this means that the derivatives are calculated for the smoothed data curve . for a cubic polynomial in general, polynomials of degree (0 and 1), [ note 3 ] (2 and 3), (4 and 5) etc. give the same coefficients for smoothing and even derivatives. polynomials of degree (1 and 2), (3 and 4) etc. give the same coefficients for odd derivatives. algebraic expressions [ edit ] it is not necessary always to use the savitzky–golay tables. the summations in the matrix j t j can be evaluated in closed form , so that algebraic formulae can be derived for the convolution coefficients. [ 13 ] [ note 4 ] functions that are suitable for use with a curve that has an inflection point are: smoothing, polynomial degree 2,3 : (the range of values for i also applies to the expressions below) 1st derivative: polynomial degree 3,4 2nd. derivative: polynomial degree 2,3 3rd. derivative: polynomial degree 3,4 simpler expressions that can be used with curves that don't have an inflection point are: smoothing, polynomial degree 0,1 (moving average): 1st derivative, polynomial degree 1,2: higher derivatives can be obtained. for example, a fourth derivative can be obtained by performing two passes of a second derivative function. [ 14 ] use of orthogonal polynomials [ edit ] an alternative to fitting m data points by a simple polynomial in the subsidiary variable, z , is to use orthogonal polynomials . where p 0 .. p k is a set of mutually orthogonal polynomials of degree 0 .. k . full details on how to obtain expressions for the orthogonal polynomials and the relationship between the coefficients b and a are given by guest. [ 2 ] expressions for the convolution coefficients are easily obtained because the normal equations matrix, j t j , is a diagonal matrix as the product of any two orthogonal polynomials is zero by virtue of their mutual orthogonality. therefore, each non-zero element of its inverse is simply the reciprocal the corresponding element in the normal equation matrix. the calculation is further simplified by using recursion to build orthogonal gram polynomials . the whole calculation can be coded in a few lines of pascal , a computer language well-adapted for calculations involving recursion. [ 15 ] treatment of first and last points [ edit ] savitzky–golay filters are most commonly used to obtain the smoothed or derivative value at the central point, z = 0, using a single set of convolution coefficients. ( m  − 1)/2 points at the start and end of the series cannot be calculated using this process. various strategies can be employed to avoid this inconvenience. the data could be artificially extended by adding, in reverse order, copies of the first ( m  − 1)/2 points at the beginning and copies of the last ( m  − 1)/2 points at the end. for instance, with m  = 5, two points are added at the start and end of the data y 1 , ..., y n . y 3 , y 2 , y 1 , ... , y n , y n −1 , y n −2 . looking again at the fitting polynomial, it is obvious that data can be calculated for all values of z by using all sets of convolution coefficients for a single polynomial, a 0 .. a k . for a cubic polynomial convolution coefficients for the missing first and last points can also be easily obtained. [ 15 ] this is also equivalent to fitting the first ( m +1)/2 points with the same polynomial, and similarly for the last points. weighting the data [ edit ] it is implicit in the above treatment that the data points are all given equal weight. technically, the objective function being minimized in the least-squares process has unit weights, w i =1. when weights are not all the same the normal equations become , if the same set of diagonal weights is used for all data subsets, w = diag(w 1 ,w 2 ,...w m ), an analytical solution to the normal equations can be written down. for example, with a quadratic polynomial, an explicit expression for the inverse of this matrix can be obtained using cramer's rule . a set of convolution coefficients may then be derived as . alternatively the coefficients, c , could be calculated in a spreadsheet, employing a built-in matrix inversion routine to obtain the inverse of the normal equations matrix. this set of coefficients, once calculated and stored, can be used with all calculations in which the same weighting scheme applies. a different set of coefficients is needed for each different weighting scheme. two-dimensional convolution coefficients [ edit ] two-dimensional smoothing and differentiation can also be applied to tables of data values, such as intensity values in a photographic image which is composed of a rectangular grid of pixels. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] the trick is to transform part of the table into a row by a simple ordering of the indices of the pixels. whereas the one-dimensional filter coefficients are found by fitting a polynomial in the subsidiary variable, z to a set of m data points, the two-dimensional coefficients are found by fitting a polynomial in subsidiary variables v and w to a set of m × m data points. the following example, for a bicubic polynomial and m = 5, illustrates the process, which parallels the process for the one dimensional case, above. [ 18 ] the square of 25 data values, d 1  −  d 25 v −2 −1 0 1 2 w −2 d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 d 5 −1 d 6 d 7 d 8 d 9 d 10 0 d 11 d 12 d 13 d 14 d 15 1 d 16 d 17 d 18 d 19 d 20 2 d 21 d 22 d 23 d 24 d 25 becomes a vector when the rows are placed one after another. d = ( d 1 ... d 25 ) t the jacobian has 10 columns, one for each of the parameters a 00  −  a 03 and 25 rows, one for each pair of v and w values. each row has the form the convolution coefficients are calculated as the first row of c contains 25 convolution coefficients which can be multiplied with the 25 data values to provide a smoothed value for the central data point (13) of the 25. a matlab [ 19 ] routine for computing the coefficients is available. 3-dimensional filters can be obtained with a similar procedure. [ 16 ] some properties of convolution [ edit ] the sum of convolution coefficients for smoothing is equal to one. the sum of coefficients for odd derivatives is zero. [ 20 ] the sum of squared convolution coefficients for smoothing is equal to the value of the central coefficient. [ 21 ] smoothing of a function leaves the area under the function unchanged. [ 20 ] convolution of a symmetric function with even-derivative coefficients conserves the centre of symmetry. [ 20 ] properties of derivative filters. [ 22 ] signal distortion and noise reduction [ edit ] it is inevitable that the signal will be distorted in the convolution process. from property 3 above, when data which has a peak is smoothed the peak height will be reduced and the half-width will be increased. both the extent of the distortion and s/n ( signal-to-noise ratio ) improvement: decrease as the degree of the polynomial increases increase as the width, m of the convolution function increases effect of smoothing on data points with uncorrelated noise of unit standard deviation for example, if the noise in all data points is uncorrelated and has a constant standard deviation , σ, the standard deviation on the noise will be decreased by convolution with an m -point smoothing function to [ 21 ] polynomial degree 0 or 1: ( moving average ) polynomial degree 2 or 3: . these functions are shown in the plot at the right. for example, with a 9-point linear function (moving average) two thirds of the noise is removed and with a 9-point quadratic/cubic smoothing function only about half the noise is removed. most of the noise remaining is low-frequency noise(see frequency characteristics of convolution filters , below). although the moving average function gives the best noise reduction it is unsuitable for smoothing data which has curvature over m points. a quadratic filter function is unsuitable for getting a derivative of a data curve with an inflection point because a quadratic polynomial does not have one. the optimal choice of polynomial order and number of convolution coefficients will be a compromise between noise reduction and distortion. [ 23 ] multipass filters [ edit ] one way to mitigate distortion and improve noise removal is to use a filter of smaller width and perform more than one convolution with it. for two passes of the same filter this is equivalent to one pass of a filter obtained by convolution of the original filter with itself. [ 24 ] for example, 2 passes of the filter with coefficients (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) is equivalent to 1 pass of the filter with coefficients (1/9, 2/9, 3/9, 2/9, 1/9). the disadvantage of multipassing is that the equivalent filter width for n passes of an m -point function is n ( m − 1) + 1 so multipassing is subject to greater end-effects. nevertheless, multipassing has been used to great advantage. for instance, some 40–80 passes on data with a signal-to-noise ratio of only 5 gave useful results. [ 25 ] the noise reduction formulae given above do not apply because correlation between calculated data points increases with each pass. frequency characteristics of convolution filters [ edit ] fourier transform of the 9-point quadratic/cubic smoothing function convolution maps to multiplication in the fourier co-domain . the discrete fourier transform of a convolution filter is a real-valued function which can be represented as θ runs from 0 to 180 degrees , after which the function merely repeats itself. the plot for a 9-point quadratic/cubic smoothing function is typical. at very low angle, the plot is almost flat, meaning that low-frequency components of the data will be virtually unchanged by the smoothing operation. as the angle increases the value decreases so that higher frequency components are more and more attenuated. this shows that the convolution filter can be described as a low-pass filter : the noise that is removed is primarily high-frequency noise and low-frequency noise passes through the filter. [ 26 ] some high-frequency noise components are attenuated more than others, as shown by undulations in the fourier transform at large angles. this can give rise to small oscillations in the smoothed data. [ 27 ] convolution and correlation [ edit ] convolution affects the correlation between errors in the data. the effect of convolution can be expressed as a linear transformation. by the law of error propagation , the variance-covariance matrix of the data, a will be transformed into b according to to see how this applies in practice, consider the effect of a 3-point moving average on the first three calculated points, y 2  −  y 4 , assuming that the data points have equal variance and that there is no correlation between them. a will be an identity matrix multiplied by a constant, σ 2 , the variance at each point. in this case the correlation coefficients , between calculated points i and j will be , in general, the calculated values are correlated even when the observed values are not correlated. the correlation extends over m  − 1 calculated points at a time. [ 28 ] multipass filters [ edit ] to illustrate the effect of multipassing on the noise and correlation of a set of data, consider the effects of a second pass of a 3-point moving average filter. for the second pass [ note 5 ] after two passes, the standard deviation of the central point has decreased to = 0.48σ, compared to 0.58σ for one pass. the noise reduction is a little less than would be obtained with one pass of a 5-point moving average which, under the same conditions, would result in the smoothed points having the smaller standard deviation of 0.45σ. correlation now extends over a span of 4 sequential points with correlation coefficients the advantage obtained by performing two passes with the narrower smoothing function is that it introduces less distortion into the calculated data. see also [ edit ] kernel smoother – different terminology for many of the same processes, used in statistics local regression — the loess and lowess methods numerical differentiation – application to differentiation of functions smoothing spline stencil (numerical analysis) – application to the solution of differential equations appendix [ edit ] tables of selected convolution coefficients [ edit ] consider a set of data points ( x j , y j ) 1 ≤ j ≤ n . the savitzky–golay tables refer to the case that the step x j  −  x j  − 1 is constant, h . examples of the use of the so-called convolution coefficients, with a cubic polynomial and a window size, m , of 5 points are as follows. smoothing:  ; 1st derivative:  ; 2nd. derivative: . selected values of the convolution coefficients for polynomials of degree 1,2,3, 4 and 5 are given in the following tables. the values were calculated using the pascal code provided in gorry.

(a ball traveling at 30 mph moves less than a foot in 20 ms.) pixy is fast, so your robot can be fast -- shown with glasses and wig (optional). teach it the objects you're interested in pixy is unique because you can physically teach it what you are interested in sensing. purple dinosaur? place the dinosaur in front of pixy and press the button. orange ball? place the ball in front of pixy and press the button. it’s easy, and it's fast. more specifically, you teach pixy by holding the object in front of its lens while holding down the button located on top. while doing this, the rgb led under the lens provides feedback regarding which object it is looking at directly. for example, the led turns orange when an orange ball is placed directly in front of pixy. release the button and pixy generates a statistical model of the colors contained in the object and stores them in flash. it will then use this statistical model to find objects with similar color signatures in its frame from then on. pixy being taught. when color led matches the color of the object, release button. pixy will then find objects that match. pixy can learn seven color signatures, numbered 1-7. color signature 1 is the default signature. to teach pixy the other signatures (2-7) requires a simple button pressing sequence. about the cost of two sonar sensors we’ve done our best to keep the cost of pixy as low as possible. improvements in technology deserve much of the credit, but this kickstarter campaign is a big help also. the kickstarter funds allow us to manufacture in sufficient quantity to get the parts and manufacturing costs down. the result is that pixy is available to a wider audience, which has always been the point of the cmucam: to put a capable, easy to use vision sensor in the hands of lots of people. pixymon lets you see what pixy sees pixymon is an application that runs on your pc or mac. it allows you to see what pixy sees, either as raw or processed video. it also allows you to configure your pixy, set the output port and manage color signatures. pixymon communicates with pixy over a standard mini usb cable. pixymon is great for debugging your application. you can plug a usb cable into the back of pixy and run pixymon and then see what pixy sees while it is hooked to your arduino or other microcontroller -- no need to unplug anything. pixymon is open source, like everything else. it's written using the qt framework. pixymon runs on pc or mac and allows you to see what pixy sees. communication takes place over standard usb cable. what’s a “color code”? a color code (cc) is two or more color tags placed close together. pixy can detect and decode ccs and present them as special objects. ccs are useful if you have lots of objects you want to detect and identify (i.e. more than could be detected with the seven separate color signatures alone.) simple color code (left), as pixy sees it (right, shown via pixymon) in the video, we created ccs with 2 color tags using 4 different colors (identified by teaching pixy 4 different color signatures). depending on your requirements, such a scheme (2 tags, 4 colors) can detect up to 12 unique objects. ccs with 3, 4 and 5 tags and/or more different colors are possible and can allow for many, many more unique objects. (in fact, thousands of unique codes are possible by using ccs with 5 tags and 6 colors. hello inkjet printer!) why color codes? ccs are useful if you have lots of objects you want to detect and identify, more than could be detected with the seven separate color signatures alone. ccs also improve detection accuracy by decreasing false detections. that is, there is a low probability that specific colors will occur both in a specific order and close together. the drawback is that you need to place a cc on each object you’re interested in detecting. often the object you’re interested in (yellow ball, purple toy) has a unique color signature and ccs aren’t needed. objects with ccs and objects without ccs can be used side-by-side with no problems, so you are free to use ccs for some objects and not others. ccs give you an accurate angle estimate of the object (in addition to the position and size). this is a computational “freebie” that some applications may find useful. the angle estimate, decoded ccs, regular objects and all of their positions and sizes are provided at 50 frames per second. ccs might be particularly useful for helping a robot navigate. for example, an indoor environment with ccs uniquely identifying each doorway and hallway would be both low-cost and robust. the team rich legrand has been playing with robots and embedded systems for 25 years. he started charmed labs in 2002 with the goal of “bringing advanced technologies to new audiences by making the technologies easy to use and affordable. and to have fun in the process.” (that's pixy!) scott robinson started working on pixy as a graduate student at cmu. his focus has typically been in embedded systems, ai, and computer vision, which is why the cmucam has been such a great fit for him. he's now working at sandia national laboratories as an r&d engineer and is continuing to provide frequent updates to the cmucam project. you can check out his blog at stackabuse.com anthony rowe is a faculty member at carnegie mellon university who has worked in the area of embedded systems for more than a decade his group at cmu studies the design of next generation connected sensing and control systems. part of this work included earlier versions of the cmucam, which we hope to take to the next level through this project. how will the funds be used? in order to get the pricing down for pixy, we need to manufacture in sufficient quantities (1000 or more.) the funds will be used to buy parts and to make manufacturing and test fixtures for future builds. technical specs processor: nxp lpc4330 , 204 mhz, dual core image sensor: omnivision ov9715 , 1/4\", 1280x800 lens field-of-view: 75 degrees horizontal, 47 degrees vertical lens type: standard m12 (several different types available) power consumption: 140 ma typical power input: usb input (5v) or unregulated input (6v to 10v) ram: 264k bytes flash: 1m bytes available data outputs: uart serial, spi, i2c, usb, digital, analog dimensions: 2.1\" x 1.75\" x 1.4\" pixy running your algorithm pixy will ship with the software and firmware that will do everything seen in the video and described here. you can use this software and firmware as-is (we expect 90% of users to do this.) or you can build on it, modify it, or completely replace it. pixy is a good, low-cost, general purpose vision platform for running other algorithms -- a qr code decoder, a face detector, an interactive pointing device (a la mouse), or something entirely different and new. all software and firmware is open source and gpl licensed. all hardware is open under the open source hardware license. (this means you can do pretty much anything you want -- even sell what you've created.) pixy's ports (back of pixy) i/o port pinouts communication (protocols and such) pixy communicates through uart, spi, i2c, digital or analog output. you can configure which interface you want to use through pixymon. the serial interfaces (uart, spi, i2c) use a simple binary protocol. every 20 ms, pixy outputs a list of objects it has detected with each object represented by an \"object block\" (see below). the protocol is data-efficient binary. the objects in each frame are sorted by size, with the largest objects sent first. you can configure the maximum number of objects sent per frame i2c relies on polling to receive updates. usb is also available, and uses a different protocol (same protocol pixymon uses.) object block data fields. pixy sends an object block for each detected object in each frame. no microcontroller necessary pixy can also use a simple digital and analog output to communicate with simple devices such as relays, motors and lights. when communicating via analog, the analog output represents the x or y position of the largest detected object of a specified color signature that exceeds a specified size. when communicating through digital, the digital output goes high when an object of a specified color signature exceeds a specified size. design longevity image sensors are consumer devices -- new sensors are released every year that take advantage of new process technologies, and older sensors are discontinued. it's not unusual for an image sensor to have a lifetime of only a couple years. any device that uses an image sensor will have to contend with this issue -- there will come a day when the specific image sensor in the design will no longer be available. previous cmucams had this problem and had to be discontinued. pixy addresses this issue on several fronts: we chose an image sensor that is targeted for the automotive industry. automotive products (silicon devices) have longer lifetimes. we chose a basic sensor with raw bayer output. this is the most common type of sensor, and when/if we need to switch sensors, we will have a large selection to choose from, and the code changes will be minimal. we did not choose a camera module (sensor/lens combination). we mount the image sensor ourselves and use a standard m12 lens holder and lens. camera modules tend to have the shortest product lifetimes because they target the fast-paced smart phone, tablet, and laptop industry. an m12 lens is also replaceable -- you can choose a different lens with a field-of-view and f-stop that works best for your application. (we chose a lens with a 75-degree horizontal field-of-view and f1.2, which is great for robotics applications, but you can easily replace.) pixy is ready we have lined up a reputable contract manufacturer that can easily handle the quantities we anticipate. they will handle all component procurement, pcb fabrication, component placement and assembled product testing. this contract manufacturer was able to complete every manufacturing step and deliver a working product in our most recent production run. when we have the funds for a larger production run, our contract manufacturer will be ready! risks and challenges learn about accountability on kickstarter pixy has already been through two revisions and two small production runs. the current version is mature and ready for production. the latest was a trial production run with the contract manufacturer that we plan to use for large-quantity production. still, there are risks with any hardware product, particularly with parts procurement and manufacturing issues, but we feel we have reduced these risks significantly. we have verified all algorithms that will ship with the completed version, but there is still a fair amount of software that needs to be readied for release. reducing the amount of time this takes will be our biggest challenge. faq can pixy do face tracking, face detection, or facial recognition? facial recognition is a more difficult problem than face detection, so let's just focus on face detection (for now). pixy will not ship with face detection/tracking functionality, but since we've had such a huge response for this functionality, we're committed to bringing it to you as soon as possible. we're looking at a few possible algorithms. we have experience with viola-jones and have seen good results ( http://www.cmucam.org/projects/cmucam3/wiki/viola-jones ) but-- yes, expect this to come out before the end of the year! last updated: fri, aug 23 2013 3:38 pm edt will there be support for linux? pixymon is written using the free version of qt, and the usb communication is handled using libusb--- so linux is totally possible, maybe even pretty simple to port over to. we didn't want to promise linux and then possibly delay the shipping schedule. but we agree that linux support would be great and it's on the todo list for sure. last updated: fri, aug 23 2013 1:28 pm edt what about raspberry pi support? it appears that qt is ported for raspberry pi. we haven't played with it, but we assume it works well enough to run pixymon (which isn't a complex qt program). libusb certainly works on raspberry pi -- so our guess is it would be an easy recompile. maybe someone could shed more light on this, but we're thinking it'll be easy to get working. last updated: fri, aug 23 2013 2:32 pm edt will pixy track/sense laser light? yes! and we have a video! http://youtu.be/g-jbestwejg it requires that you reduce the shutter on the imager so the laser light isn't overexposed. (you can adjust the shutter setting in pixymon.) our color analysis algorithm works for finding a laser dot (it simply looks for a red object, assuming a red laser of course). last updated: mon, sep 9 2013 10:23 am edt what is the maximum distance that pixy can detect objects? pixy can detect an object that is miles away as long as the object is large enough. described another way -- pixy will detect an object that's as small as 4x1 pixels in the image. this means it can detect a ping-pong ball sized object at 10 feet, assuming a 75 degree field-of-view lens (the lens pixy will ship with). a lens with a longer focal length can greatly extend the detection distance, but with a narrower field of view. last updated: fri, aug 23 2013 2:32 pm edt can i replace the lens on pixy, you know, to reduce or extend the field of view (or reduce or extend the focal length)? you can! pixy will ship with a 75-degree field of view lens, which is great for robotics applications, but your application may need something different, perhaps something that can see distant objects better (longer focal length) or see more objects (wider field of view and shorter focal length). or a lens without an ir-cut filter, so that pixy has the best ir response. pixy uses a standard m12 lens. these are available through several vendors. here's an example (there are others): http://www.m12lenses.com/board-lenses-s/12.htm we may end up selling different lens options with pixy, but at the very least, we'll create a list of lenses that work well with pixy and where to purchase. last updated: fri, aug 23 2013 2:40 pm edt ask a question report this project to kickstarter 2,802 backers $274,352 pledged of $25,000 goal 0 seconds to go project by charmed labs and carnegie mellon austin, tx first created · 3 backed has not connected facebook charmedlabs.com see full bio contact me you selected pledge $10 or more 26 backers pixy supporter -- you will become part of our source code!

}; call ( greet , 'hello' , 'tom' ) //=> 'hello, tom!' apply ( greet , [ 'hello' , 'tom' ]) //=> 'hello, tom!' their \"special sauce\" is that they automatically curry the supplied function, so if you provide fewer or no arguments, you get back a partially applied or curried function: call ( greet )( 'hello' )( 'tom' ) //=> 'hello, tom!' call ( greet , 'hello' )( 'tom' ) //=> 'hello, tom!' apply ( greet , [])( 'hello' )( 'tom' ) //=> 'hello, tom!' apply ( greet , [ 'hello' ])( 'tom' ) //=> 'hello, tom!' immediate application if you don't want the currying/partial application behaviour, there is an immediate application version named (appropriately), callnow (and also another named applynow , not shown): callnow ( greet , 'hello' , 'tom' ) //=> 'hello, tom!' callnow ( greet , 'hello' ) //=> 'hello, undefined!' variations on the order of applying the arguments callright applies any arguments supplied to the right. if you supply all the arguments, it's the same as call , but if you supply fewer arguments, you get a right partial application: callright ( greet , 'hello' , 'tom' ) //=> 'hello, tom!' callright ( greet , 'hello' )( 'tom' ) //=> 'tom, hello!' callflipped applies the arguments backwards, even when curried: callflipped ( greet , 'hello' , 'tom' ) //=> 'tom, hello!' callflipped ( greet , 'hello' )( 'tom' ) //=> 'tom, hello!' callflipped ( greet )( 'hello' )( 'tom' ) //=> 'tom, hello!' more partial application callleft is actually synonymous with call : it applies arguments given to the left. we've seen callright above. both are variadic : you can supply as many arguments as you want. callfirst and calllast are just like callleft and callright , but they are binary functions: they accept a function and exactly one argument. this is sometimes useful when combining functions together. callfirst and calllast both have \"flipped and curried\" versions ( callfirstwith and calllastwith ). calllastwith is especially useful for working with functions written in \"collection - operation\" style. here we take advantage of the fact that they are \"automatically curried\" to implement the popular pluck function. currying allong.es does support the curry function, it is implemented as the unary form of call : var curry = unary ( call ); with splat was present in earlier versions of allong.es but has been deprecated as being too cryptic. instead, there is a general naming convention that works as follows. many binary functions such as map and filter are historically written to take a noun or collection as the first argument and a verb as the second. however, reversing and currying these functions is super-useful as it makes composeable functions out of them. that's why callflipped is so important. but to save you the trouble of writing callflipped map everywhere, many such functions in allong.es have a clipped version pre-defined and named with the suffix with : map(list, function) <=> mapwith(function, list) filter(list, function) <=> filterwith(function, list) get(object, propertyname) <=> getwith(propertyname, object) pluck(list, propertyname) <=> pluckwith(propertyname, list) so you \"map\" a list, but \"mapwith\" a function. and of course, they are all curried. for example: map(list)(function) <=> mapwith(function)(list) deepmap(list)(function) <=> deepmapwith(function)(list) filter(list)(function) <=> filterwith(function)(list) get(object)(propertyname) <=> getwith(propertyname)(object) pluck(list)(propertyname) <=> pluckwith(propertyname)(list) thus if you have a collection such as: var users = [ { name : 'huey' }, { name : 'dewey' }, { name : 'louie' } ] you can get the names with either: pluck ( users , 'name' ) //=> ['huey', 'dewey', 'louie'] or: pluckwith ( 'name' , users ) //=> ['huey', 'dewey', 'louie'] the latter is interesting because pluck and pluckwith are both automatically curried (like almost everything that isn't named \"now\"). thus, we could also write: var namesof = pluckwith ( 'name' ); // ... namesof ( users ) //=> ['huey', 'dewey', 'louie'] arity function decorators variadic makes a function into a variadic (accepts any number of arguments). the last named parameter will be given an array of arguments. var variadic = require ( 'allong.es' ). allong . es . variadic ; var fn = variadic ( function ( a ) { return a }) fn () //=> [] fn ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) //=> [1,2,3] fn = variadic ( function ( a , b ) { return { a : a , b : b } }) fn () //=> { a: undefined, b: [] } fn ( 1 ) //=> { a: 1, b: [] } fn ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) //=> { a: 1, b: [2, 3] } variadic, part ii when given just the function, variadic returns a function with an arity of zero. this is consistent with javascript programming practice. there are times when you wish to report an arity, meaning that you want the returned function to have its length getibute set. you do this by prefacing the function argument with a length: fn = variadic ( function ( a , b ) { return { a : a , b : b } }); fn . length //=> 0 fn2 = variadic ( 1 , function ( a , b ) { return { a : a , b : b } }); fn2 . length //=> 1 unary, binary, and ternary sometimes, you have a function that takes multiple arguments, but you only want it to accept one, or two, or maybe three arguments and ignore the rest. for example, parseint takes a radix as an optional second parameter. and that is havoc if you try to use it with array.map : [ '1' , '2' , '3' , '4' , '5' ]. map ( parseint ) //=> [ 1, // nan, // nan, // nan, // nan ] use unary(parseint) to solve the problem: [ '1' , '2' , '3' , '4' , '5' ]. map ( unary ( parseint )) //=> [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] binary has similar uses when working with array.reduce and its habit of passing three parameters to your supplied function. miscellaneous combinators bound var bound = require ( 'allong.es' ). allong . es . bound ;
