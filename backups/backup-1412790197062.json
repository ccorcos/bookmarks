(link to video on tudou , for mainland china readers) problem statement i download lot's of pdfs, which are all for some reason named fulltext.pdf. i end up with a downloads directory with hundreds or thousands of files. i take notes on paper, in devonthink, in simple note, and cannot find what i need. i feel like i am loosing control over what i am learning, and have problems “converging” - bringing different theoretical ideas together. and then i end up writing final papers, hand-formatting citations, and having no way of linking the final paper to my earlier notes. in all of this, i'd love for some simple way to share my notes and ideas with others. solution the solution for me came in the form of a few programs that were already amazingly powerful and capable. bibdesk for managing citations (i tried pretty much every possible bibliographic manager, and then some), a very powerful open source citation manager based on the open bibtex format (which might be a bit unwieldy, but is quite universally understood). as the information management system, i chose dokuwiki , a really great wiki which does not use a database, but plain text files (this made it much easier both to interact with programmatically, and to sync between my local computer and a server). there's a vibrant community of developers and lot's of great plugins available (some of the important plugins for this project ). \"glue scripts\" the realization that i could access applescript in ruby through appscript-rb made a huge difference. i didn't want to learn a whole new language, but since i often only need one or two lines of appscript in a script, this was a perfect solution. it took some practice to learn to craft obscure lines like app ( \"google chrome\" ) . windows [ 1 ] . get . tabs [ dt. windows [ 1 ] . get . active_tab_index . get ] . get . url . get but once you get it, it's incredibly powerful. finding sylvester keils ' bibtex-ruby and citeproc-ruby , which allowed me to process bibtex files and generate citations. sylvester has been incredibly helpful whenever i ran into snags or problems. future proofing i've put quite a lot of time into experimenting with these scripts etc, much of it because i was learning so much along the way, and also because i was gradually learning what was useful to my own learning - i didn't start out with a blueprint. someone might very well come along and make much better scripts, or integrated programs that are more functional than my setup. however, i am also spending a ton of time importing articles and metadata, reading and taking notes from articles, synthesizing into topical articles, etc. how “future proof” is all this? will it all be useless in a few years, when a much better tool comes along? i don't think so. bibtex is not perfect, but it's an open standard that is recognized by almost every program - it would not be difficult to import all citations and pdfs to another citation management system, should i wish to do so in the future. it should also not be that hard to move the notes and highlights from the wiki to another system, if i should ever want to do so - i might miss some of the functionality, but the information is there, in simple text files that are easy to process and export. i'm convinced, i want to use this system too! some of you might read this far, and say - this looks really neat, i'd like to install it on my computer and start using it for my research. unfortunately, given that this isn't one single program, but rather a combination of a bunch of programs, and scripts that integrate with those programs, it's impossible for me to create one simple installer which will let you jump right in and use this setup. so why i am spending all this time documenting this? in my mind, there are two kinds of “target groups”. the first are tinkerers, who are comfortable with ruby, the terminal, etc. all of my scripts are available, and i've made some effort to document them, as well as (perhaps more valuably) documenting some of the “neat ways of doing things” that took me a long time to find. i hope this will be useful to you. perhaps you want to try to replicate the entire setup - it would be quite a bit of work, but it's certainly possible. perhaps you just want a certain component (say side-by-side editing in dokuwiki, or automatic import of kindle annotations)? this should also be quite doable (and if people contact me and tell me that a certain component would be very useful, i might try to separate that out, document it, and make it easier for people to access just that functionality). but to people who are not able to or willing to spend lot's of time looking over scripts and commands, i hope that this could still be interesting as a demo of what is possible. during a university class, i was part of a group that designed a “mockup” of an academic workflow that we called “junior researchr” (this is where i took the name from). what we showed in that video was not a functional workflow, but something we “simulated”. in this case, the system i am showing you is something that i am using every day for hours, and exactly how it works has been shaped intimately by how i think. i think we all deserve much more powerful tools for thinking and managing knowledge, and this is my “stab” at it. i am also fascinated by the relationship between how we grapple with ideas individually, and how we can do so in groups (i wrote about this here ), and the one thing my system is missing is a social network. i don't want to open my wiki up to editing, but i'd love lot's of others to write about articles on blogs and wikis, and to be able to very easily discover those posts, and share our ideas. contact feel free to get in touch with me by e-mail for feedback or questions. i am happy to assist with using or modifying any of these scripts, or discussing the ideas behind them. read more conceptual screenshots of the functionality anatomy of a publication page what are citekeys, and why are they so important?

[ 1 ] it can also be shown that a complex number is constructible if and only if its real and imaginary parts are constructible. the set of constructible numbers can be completely characterized in the language of field theory : the constructible numbers form the quadratic closure of the rational numbers : the smallest field extension that is closed under square root and complex conjugation . this has the effect of transforming geometric questions about compass and straightedge constructions into algebra . this transformation leads to the solutions of many famous mathematical problems, which defied centuries of attack. contents 1 geometric definitions 2 transformation into algebra 3 impossible constructions 4 see also 5 notes 6 references geometric definitions [ edit ] the geometric definition of a constructible point is as follows. first, for any two distinct points p and q in the plane, let l ( p , q ) denote the unique line through p and q , and let c ( p , q ) denote the unique circle with center p , passing through q . (note that the order of p and q matters for the circle.) by convention, l ( p , p ) = c ( p , p ) = { p }. then a point z is constructible from e, f, g and h if either z is in the intersection of l ( e , f ) and l ( g , h ), where l ( e , f ) ≠ l ( g , h ); z is in the intersection of c ( e , f ) and c ( g , h ), where c ( e , f ) ≠ c ( g , h ); z is in the intersection of l ( e , f ) and c ( g , h ). since the order of e , f , g , and h in the above definition is irrelevant, the four letters may be permuted in any way. put simply, z is constructible from e , f , g and h if it lies in the intersection of any two distinct lines, or of any two distinct circles, or of a line and a circle, where these lines and/or circles can be determined by e , f , g , and h , in the above sense. now, let a and a ′ be any two distinct fixed points in the plane. a point z is constructible if either z = a ; z = a ′; there exist points p 0 , ..., p n , with z = p n , such that for all j ≥ 1, p j + 1 is constructible from points in the set { p 0 , ..., p j } where p 0 = a and p 1 = a ′. put simply, z is constructible if it is either a or a ′, or if it is obtainable from a finite sequence of points starting with a and a ′, where each new point is constructible from previous points in the sequence. for example, the center point of a and a ′ is defined as follows. the circles c ( a , a ′) and c ( a ′, a ) intersect in two distinct points; these points determine a unique line, and the center is defined to be the intersection of this line with l ( a , a ′). transformation into algebra [ edit ] all rational numbers are constructible, and all constructible numbers are algebraic numbers . also, if a and b are constructible numbers with b ≠ 0, then a − b and a / b are constructible. thus, the set k of all constructible complex numbers forms a field , a subfield of the field of algebraic numbers. furthermore, k is closed under square roots and complex conjugation . these facts can be used to characterize the field of constructible numbers, because, in essence, the equations defining lines and circles are no worse than quadratic. the characterization is the following: a complex number is constructible if and only if it lies in a field at the top of a finite tower of quadratic extensions , starting with the rational field q . more precisely, z is constructible if and only if there exists a tower of fields where z is in k n and for all 0 ≤ j < n , the dimension [ k j + 1  : k j ] = 2. impossible constructions [ edit ] the algebraic characterization of constructible numbers provides an important necessary condition for constructibility: if z is constructible, then it is algebraic, and its minimal irreducible polynomial has degree a power of 2, or equivalently, the field extension q ( z )/ q has dimension a power of 2. one should note that it is true, (but not obvious to show) that the converse is false — this is not a sufficient condition for constructibility. however, this defect can be remedied by considering the normal closure of q ( z )/ q . the non-constructibility of certain numbers proves the impossibility of certain problems attempted by the philosophers of ancient greece . in the following chart, each row represents a specific ancient construction problem. the left column gives the name of the problem. the second column gives an equivalent algebraic formulation of the problem. in other words, the solution to the problem is affirmative if and only if each number in the given set of numbers is constructible. finally, the last column provides the simplest known counterexample . in other words, the number in the last column is an element of the set in the same row, but is not constructible. construction problem associated set of numbers counterexample doubling the cube is not constructible, because its minimal polynomial has degree 3 over q trisecting the angle is not constructible, because has minimal polynomial of degree 3 over q squaring the circle is not constructible, because it is not algebraic over q constructing all regular polygons is not constructible, because 7 is not a fermat prime , nor is 7 the product of and one or more fermat primes see also [ edit ] computable number definable real number compass and straightedge constructions notes [ edit ] ^ john a. beachy, william d. blair;

-- to be proven after dr steven halim finished this experiment with his algorithm class this semester) increase his/her students mastery on these basic questions as the students have virtually infinite number of training questions that can be verified instantly before they take the online quiz. to try this exciting online quiz feature, click the \"start training!\" button on the top right corner of this page. bug reports or request for new features visualgo is not a finished project. dr steven halim and his team are still actively improving visualgo. if you spot a bug in any of our visualization page/online quiz tool or if you want to request for new features, please contact dr \"steven halim\". his contact is the concatenation of his name and add gmail dot com. publications this work has been presented briefly at the cli workshop at the acm icpc world finals 2012 (poland, warsaw) and at the ioi conference at ioi 2012 (sirmione-montichiari, italy). you can click this link to read our 2012 paper about this system (it was not yet called visualgo back in 2012). frequently asked questions (only in english) the list below contains the answers to frequently asked questions since this site went public in early august 2014: q: visualgo does not look nice on small screen (e.g. smartphones). will your team do something about this? a: no, we have decided to give up our past pursuit to optimize visualgo for small screen due to the need to cater many complex algorithm visualizations that require lots of pixels. the minimum resolution for respectable user experience is 1024x768 . we admit that it will be too painful to watch visualgo animations on today's smartphones (it is ok on tablets). note that you also cannot do the click-and-drag gesture for graph drawing on smartphones and tablets. q: are you going to make visualgo an open-source project so that other developers can extend it, edit certain visualizations to their liking, edit the language of the visualizations, etc? a: probably... we are still undecided about this. however, we have started the localization sub-project of the index.html of this site. if you are interested to translate various computer science terminologies to your native language, please contact steven. we are particularly interested with spanish, hindustani, arabic, and french speakers :). q: as visualgo (minus the online quiz system) is basically a collection of client-side html/css/js files, can i download all the required files locally so that i can use visualgo without connecting to the internet? a: go ahead, by doing so, you will have the offline copy of visualgo :). if internet connection in your place is not that good, this can be a good idea. however, do revisit visualgo (or re-download all files) once a while to get the latest updates. we are still actively developing this tool. note that visualgo online quiz system is on server-side and technically can never be on client-side to ensure fairness during online quiz. that feature will remain online by nature. q: can i download visualgo files and host it locally on my own website verbatim ? a: big no, this is plagiarism . if you want to extend/edit visualgo (see point no 2 above, please contact dr steven halim first for permission). you can have a local copy of visualgo (see point no 3 above) but you can not re-host the same set of files elsewhere. q: i am a cs lecturer/instructor/student, can i use your visualgo for my data structures and/or algorithms class(es) (or the class(es) that i take)? a: by all means, go ahead. we build this tool for all computer scientists on earth. if you like what you see, we want you to tell the existence of visualgo to other computer scientists that you know =). if you have a facebook, twitter, or other social media account(s), go ahead and share the existance of visualgo to your friends. q: this url: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/visualization for visualgo is a bit too long. are you going to register a shorter domain name? a: yes, it is http://visualgo.net or http://visualgo.org now :), you can try the following shortcuts. http://visualgo.net/bst.html (or any other direct visualization page url that you can remember) http://training.visualgo.net http://test.visualgo.net q: the training mode only contains questions for 9 modules (bst, avl, heap, ufds, bitmask, graph ds, graph traversal, mst, and sssp). are you planning to add more modules for the other visualizations? a: yes, we are planning to do that soon. the next modules in line are: sorting, linked list (and its variants), and likely hash tables (future visualization) to cater for the needs of nus cs1020 module. q: the test mode (and the answer to last test ) buttons appear only occassionally. when they appear, i cannot access them as it asks for password. is it normal? a: yes, this test mode is only for dr steven halim's current cs2010 students (aug-nov 2014). you can just access the training mode to access similar set of random questions. acknowledgements (only in english) this project is made possible by the generous teaching enhancement grant from nus centre for development of teaching and learning. about team terms of use ","createdAt":1412789665936,"_id":"VcP6D44pubqnrEpZ"}

{"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number","title":"Transcendental number - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","text":" transcendental number from wikipedia, the free encyclopedia jump to: navigation , search in mathematics , a transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not algebraic —that is, it is not a root of a non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients . the most prominent examples of transcendental numbers are π and e . though only a few classes of transcendental numbers are known (in part because it can be extremely difficult to show that a given number is transcendental), transcendental numbers are not rare. indeed, almost all real and complex numbers are transcendental, since the algebraic numbers are countable while the sets of real and complex numbers are both uncountable . all real transcendental numbers are irrational , since all rational numbers are algebraic. the converse is not true: not all irrational numbers are transcendental; e.g., the square root of 2 is irrational but not a transcendental number, since it is a solution of the polynomial equation x 2 − 2 = 0. contents 1 history 2 properties 3 numbers proven to be transcendental 4 possibly transcendental numbers 5 sketch of a proof that e is transcendental 5.1 the transcendence of π 6 mahler's classification 6.1 measure of irrationality of a real number 6.2 measure of transcendence of a complex number 6.3 koksma's equivalent classification 6.4 leveque's construction 6.5 type 7 see also 8 notes 9 references 10 external links history [ edit ] the name \"transcendental\" comes from leibniz in his 1682 paper where he proved that sin(x) is not an algebraic function of x . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] euler was probably the first person to define transcendental numbers in the modern sense. [ 3 ] joseph liouville first proved the existence of transcendental numbers in 1844, [ 4 ] and in 1851 gave the first decimal examples such as the liouville constant in which the n th digit after the decimal point is 1 if n is equal to k ! ( k factorial ) for some k and 0 otherwise. [ 5 ] liouville showed that this number is what we now call a liouville number ; this essentially means that it can be more closely approximated by rational numbers than can any irrational algebraic number. liouville showed that all liouville numbers are transcendental. [ 6 ] johann heinrich lambert conjectured that e and π were both transcendental numbers in his 1761 paper proving the number π is irrational . the first number to be proven transcendental without having been specifically constructed for the purpose was e , by charles hermite in 1873. in 1874, georg cantor proved that the algebraic numbers are countable and the real numbers are uncountable. he also gave a new method for constructing transcendental numbers. [ 7 ] in 1878, cantor published a construction that proves there are as many transcendental numbers as there are real numbers. [ 8 ] cantor's work established the ubiquity of transcendental numbers. in 1882, ferdinand von lindemann published a proof that the number π is transcendental. he first showed that e to any nonzero algebraic power is transcendental, and since e i π = −1 is algebraic (see euler's identity ), i π and therefore π must be transcendental. this approach was generalized by karl weierstrass to the lindemann–weierstrass theorem . the transcendence of π allowed the proof of the impossibility of several ancient geometric constructions involving compass and straightedge , including the most famous one, squaring the circle . in 1900, david hilbert posed an influential question about transcendental numbers, hilbert's seventh problem : if a is an algebraic number, that is not zero or one, and b is an irrational algebraic number , is a b necessarily transcendental? the affirmative answer was provided in 1934 by the gelfond–schneider theorem . this work was extended by alan baker in the 1960s in his work on lower bounds for linear forms in any number of logarithms (of algebraic numbers). [ 9 ] properties [ edit ] the set of transcendental numbers is uncountably infinite . since the polynomials with integer coefficients are countable , and since each such polynomial has a finite number of zeroes , the algebraic numbers must also be countable. but cantor's diagonal argument proves that the real numbers (and therefore also the complex numbers) are uncountable; so the set of all transcendental numbers must also be uncountable. no rational number is transcendental and all real transcendental numbers are irrational. a rational number can be written as p / q , where p and q are integers. thus, p / q is the root of qx  −  p  = 0. however, some irrational numbers are not transcendental. for example, the square root of 2 is irrational and not transcendental (because it is a solution of the polynomial equation x 2 − 2 = 0). the same is true for the square root of other non-perfect squares. any non-constant algebraic function of a single variable yields a transcendental value when applied to a transcendental argument. for example, from knowing that π is transcendental, we can immediately deduce that numbers such as 5π, (π − 3)/√ 2 , (√ π − √ 3 ) 8 and (π 5 + 7) 1/7 are transcendental as well. however, an algebraic function of several variables may yield an algebraic number when applied to transcendental numbers if these numbers are not algebraically independent . for example, π and (1 − π) are both transcendental, but π + (1 − π) = 1 is obviously not. it is unknown whether π + e , for example, is transcendental, though at least one of π + e and π e must be transcendental. more generally, for any two transcendental numbers a and b , at least one of a + b and ab must be transcendental. to see this, consider the polynomial ( x − a )( x − b ) = x 2 − ( a + b ) x + ab . if ( a + b ) and ab were both algebraic, then this would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients. because algebraic numbers form an algebraically closed field , this would imply that the roots of the polynomial, a and b , must be algebraic. but this is a contradiction, and thus it must be the case that at least one of the coefficients is transcendental. the non-computable numbers are a strict subset of the transcendental numbers. all liouville numbers are transcendental, but not vice versa. any liouville number must have unbounded partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion. using a counting argument one can show that there exist transcendental numbers which have bounded partial quotients and hence are not liouville numbers. using the explicit continued fraction expansion of e , one can show that e is not a liouville number (although the partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion are unbounded). kurt mahler showed in 1953 that π is also not a liouville number. it is conjectured that all infinite continued fractions with bounded terms that are not eventually periodic are transcendental (eventually periodic continued fractions correspond to quadratic irrationals). [ 10 ] a related class of numbers are closed-form numbers , which may be defined in various ways, including rational numbers (and in some definitions all algebraic numbers), but also allow exponentiation and logarithm. numbers proven to be transcendental [ edit ] numbers proven to be transcendental: e a if a is algebraic and nonzero (by the lindemann–weierstrass theorem ). π (by the lindemann–weierstrass theorem ). e π , gelfond's constant , as well as e −π/2 = i i (by the gelfond–schneider theorem ). a b where a is algebraic but not 0 or 1, and b is irrational algebraic (by the gelfond–schneider theorem), in particular: the gelfond–schneider constant (or hilbert number). the continued fraction constant, carl ludwig siegel (1929) sin ( a ), cos( a ) and tan( a ), and their multiplicative inverses csc( a ), sec( a ) and cot( a ), for any nonzero algebraic number a (by the lindemann–weierstrass theorem). ln ( a ) if a is algebraic and not equal to 0 or 1, for any branch of the logarithm function (by the lindemann–weierstrass theorem). w ( a ) if a is algebraic and nonzero, for any branch of the lambert w function (by the lindemann–weierstrass theorem). γ (1/3), [ 11 ] γ(1/4), [ 12 ] and γ(1/6). [ 12 ] 0.12345678910111213141516..., the champernowne constant . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] ω, chaitin's constant (since it is a non-computable number). [ 15 ] the fredholm number [ 16 ] [ 17 ] more generally, any number of the form with 0 < |β| < 1 and β algebraic. [ 18 ] the aforementioned liouville constant more generally any number of the form with 0 < |β| < 1 and β algebraic the prouhet–thue–morse constant . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] any number for which the digits with respect to some fixed base form a sturmian word . [ 21 ] for β > 1 where is the floor function . possibly transcendental numbers [ edit ] numbers which have yet to be proven to be either transcendental or algebraic: most sums, products, powers, etc. of the number π and the number e , e.g. π + e , π − e , π e , π/ e , π π , e e , π e , π √ 2 , e π 2 are not known to be rational, algebraic irrational or transcendental. notable exceptions are π + e π , π e π and e π√ n (for any positive integer n ) which have been proven to be transcendental. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] the euler–mascheroni constant γ (which has not even been proven to be irrational). catalan's constant , also not known to be irrational. apéry's constant , ζ(3) (which apéry proved is irrational) the riemann zeta function at other odd integers, ζ(5), ζ(7), ... (not known to be irrational.) the feigenbaum constants , δ and α. mills' constant . conjectures: schanuel's conjecture , four exponentials conjecture . sketch of a proof that e is transcendental [ edit ] the first proof that the base of the natural logarithms, e , is transcendental dates from 1873. we will now follow the strategy of david hilbert (1862–1943) who gave a simplification of the original proof of charles hermite . the idea is the following: assume, for purpose of finding a contradiction, that e is algebraic. then there exists a finite set of integer coefficients c 0 , c 1 , ..., c n satisfying the equation: now for a positive integer k , we define the following polynomial: and multiply both sides of the above equation by to arrive at the equation: this equation can be written in the form where lemma 1. for an appropriate choice of k , is a non-zero integer. proof. each term in p is an integer times a sum of factorials, which results from the relation which is valid for any positive integer j (consider the gamma function ). it is non-zero because for every a satisfying 0< a ≤ n , the integrand in is e −x times a sum of terms whose lowest power of x is k +1 after substituting x for x - a in the integral. then this becomes a sum of integrals of the form with k +1 ≤ j , and it is therefore an integer divisible by ( k +1)!. after dividing by k! , we get zero modulo ( k +1). however, we can write: and thus by choosing k so that k +1 is prime and larger than n and | c 0 |, we get that is non-zero modulo ( k +1) and is thus non-zero. lemma 2. for sufficiently large k . proof. note that using upper bounds g and h for and on the interval [0, n ] we can infer that and since it follows that which is sufficient to finish the proof of this lemma. noting that one can choose k so that both lemmas hold we get the contradiction we needed to prove the transcendence of e . the transcendence of π [ edit ] a similar strategy, different from lindemann's original approach, can be used to show that the number π is transcendental. besides the gamma-function and some estimates as in the proof for e , facts about symmetric polynomials play a vital role in the proof. for detailed information concerning the proofs of the transcendence of π and e see the references and external links. mahler's classification [ edit ] kurt mahler in 1932 partitioned the transcendental numbers into 3 classes, called s , t , and u . [ 24 ] definition of these classes draws on an extension of the idea of a liouville number (cited above). measure of irrationality of a real number [ edit ] one way to define a liouville number is to consider how small a given real number x makes linear polynomials | qx  −  p | without making them exactly 0. here p , q are integers with | p |, | q | bounded by a positive integer  h . let m ( x , 1,  h ) be the minimum non-zero absolute value these polynomials take and take: ω( x , 1) is often called the measure of irrationality of a real number  x . for rational numbers, ω( x , 1) = 0 and is at least 1 for irrational real numbers. a liouville number is defined to have infinite measure of irrationality. roth's theorem says that irrational real algebraic numbers have measure of irrationality 1. measure of transcendence of a complex number [ edit ] next consider the values of polynomials at a complex number x , when these polynomials have integer coefficients, degree at most n , and height at most h , with n , h being positive integers. let m ( x , n , h ) be the minimum non-zero absolute value such polynomials take at x and take: suppose this is infinite for some minimum positive integer  n . a complex number x in this case is called a u number of degree  n . now we can define ω( x ) is often called the measure of transcendence of  x . if the ω( x , n ) are bounded, then ω( x ) is finite, and x is called an s number . if the ω( x , n ) are finite but unbounded, x is called a t number . x  is algebraic if and only if ω( x ) = 0. clearly the liouville numbers are a subset of the u numbers. william leveque in 1953 constructed u numbers of any desired degree. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] the liouville numbers and hence the u numbers are uncountable sets. they are sets of measure 0. [ 27 ] t numbers also comprise a set of measure 0. [ 28 ] it took about 35 years to show their existence. wolfgang m. schmidt in 1968 showed that examples exist. it follows that almost all complex numbers are s numbers. [ 29 ] mahler proved that the exponential function sends all non-zero algebraic numbers to s numbers: [ 30 ] [ 31 ] this shows that e is an s number and gives a proof of the transcendence of π. the most that is known about π is that it is not a u number. many other transcendental numbers remain unclassified. two numbers x , y are called algebraically dependent if there is a non-zero polynomial p in 2 indeterminates with integer coefficients such that p ( x ,  y ) = 0. there is a powerful theorem that 2 complex numbers that are algebraically dependent belong to the same mahler class. [ 26 ] [ 32 ] this allows construction of new transcendental numbers, such as the sum of a liouville number with e or π. it is often speculated that s stood for the name of mahler's teacher carl ludwig siegel and that t and u are just the next two letters. koksma's equivalent classification [ edit ] jurjen koksma in 1939 proposed another classification based on approximation by algebraic numbers. [ 24 ] [ 33 ] consider the approximation of a complex number x by algebraic numbers of degree ≤  n and height ≤  h . let α be an algebraic number of this finite set such that | x  − α| has the minimum positive value. define ω*( x , h , n ) and ω*( x , n ) by: if for a smallest positive integer n , ω*( x , n ) is infinite, x is called a u*-number of degree  n . if the ω*( x , n ) are bounded and do not converge to 0, x is called an s*-number , a number x is called an a*-number if the ω*( x , n ) converge to 0. if the ω*( x , n ) are all finite but unbounded, x is called a t*-number , koksma's and mahler's classifications are equivalent in that they divide the transcendental numbers into the same classes. [ 33 ] the a* -numbers are the algebraic numbers. [ 29 ] leveque's construction [ edit ] let it can be shown that the nth root of λ (a liouville number) is a u-number of degree n. [ 34 ] this construction can be improved to create an uncountable family of u-numbers of degree n . let z be the set consisting of every other power of 10 in the series above for λ. the set of all subsets of z is uncountable. deleting any of the subsets of z from the series for λ creates uncountably many distinct liouville numbers, whose nth roots are u-numbers of degree n . type [ edit ] the supremum of the sequence {ω( x ,  n )} is called the type . almost all real numbers are s numbers of type 1, which is minimal for real s numbers. almost all complex numbers are s numbers of type 1/2, which is also minimal. the claims of almost all numbers were conjectured by mahler and in 1965 proved by vladimir sprindzhuk.

(251) 273-2738 this results in 5 rings and then a sequence of 109 piano notes. i recorded this using some call recording software. http://www.speedyshare.com/ssnau/piano.wav writing down these sounds as notes gives the following set. dggbgbggdgbdgdgbdddbdgegdgdgdbdddbgdgbddgedggdgbgddddbdddddbgggggbddgggedggdgbgggbgdbgdgbgdbdgbddgbggggbgdbge converting the b’s and e’s into spaces gives us the following. dgg g ggdg dgdg ddd dg gdgdgd ddd gdg ddg dggdg gdddd ddddd ggggg ddggg dggdg ggg gd gdg gd dg ddg gggg gd g this is starting to look promising. converting the d’s into dashes and the g’s into dots we get the following. -.. . ..-. -.-. --- -. .-.-.- --- .-. --. -..-. .---- ----- ..... --... -..-. ... .- .-. .- -. --. .... .- . this is morse code and decodes into a url. http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/morse.php defcon.org/1057/saranghae fixing the capitalization we are able to connect. http://defcon.org/1057/saranghae/ going to this url leads to step_3a. step_3a going to the url from step_2. http://defcon.org/1057/saranghae/ page source: step_3a_source.txt (pastebin) picture of the page. this page contains an image. the page has a hint shown here. who we gave free love to at 1o57 are you being served? since we do not know who we gave free love to we have reached a dead end. move on to step_3b step_3b continue from dead end on step_3a we have found a large pattern on the floor near the 1o57 room. there are other symbols around defcon with different numbers and characters. (no images) taking all of the numbers we get the following list. we also have a number of korean symbols associated. 전 화 기 1.23 0.12 1.13 2.23 0.01 6.12 3.23 0.20 5.23 3.13 6.23 9.12 3.22 3.02 5.11 2.22 4.01 6.13 0.00 8.01 12.02 6.22 6.02 4.23 3.01 3.12 4.13 1.02 9.02 1.11 0.20 5.22 15.02 0.03 4.02 9.22 0.10 2.11 8.22 taking the korean symbols and mixing them around we eventually come to. 전화기 this translates to phone. we now have a hint as to how this puzzle works. taking a modern phone we can see that it is laid out as follows. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 * 0 # adding 0 based rows to this we get the following layout. 3 1 2 3 2 4 5 6 1 7 8 9 0 * 0 # 0 1 2 taking the numbers from the floor and dropping the first number. 23 12 13 23 01 12 23 20 23 13 23 12 22 02 11 22 01 13 00 01 02 22 02 23 01 12 13 02 02 11 20 22 02 03 02 22 10 11 22 this associates with the column and row on the phone. example 23 = column 2, row 3 = 3 decoding all of this we get the following. 3 5 2 3 7 5 3 # 3 2 3 5 6 4 8 6 7 3 * 7 4 6 4 3 7 5 2 4 4 8 # 6 4 1 4 6 0 8 6 ordering this by the characters that spell the word phone we get. 333266*674#1057#34774546482535824328466 using the letters associated on a phone and discovery of some crazy words we get the following. defcon*org#1057#fissilingualelucidation cleaning this up we have our new target url. defcon.org/1057/fissilingualelucidation continue to step_3c with our newfound page. step_3c going to the url from step_3b http://defcon.org/1057/fissilingualelucidation page source: step_3c_source.txt (pastebin) picture of the page. this page contains an animated gif. the poem on this page reads as follows. here, i wrote you a poem: lorem ip lorem ipsum dolor si lorem ipsum do lorem ipsum dolor s lorem ipsum ama lorem ipsum dolor sit amet lorem ipsum dolor sit ame lorem ipsum dolor sit lorem ipsum ips lorem ipsum lor lorem ipsum lo lorem ipsum lorem lorem ipsum amat lorem ipsum dropping this into google translate we see a very interesting bug. our lorem ipsum text translates to the following. internet ip let's see if we give pussycat dolls the free love it can be used our goal is to ame our goal is to vehicle dimensions free of pain china, elsewhere free internet china loves nato the source page from the site we found in step 3a_1 talked about a poem. it also stated “who we gave free love to” in this poem we see that the “free love” is given to the “pussycat dolls” continue to step_3d with this new information. step_3d using the newfound information from step_3c. we give pussycat dolls the free love we can add this to the puzzle from step_3a who we gave free love to at 1o57 are you being served?

about ready to call shenanigans? i'll let you in on a little secret...when i'm feeling deflated i sometimes think of funny little words, like sextile (rawr-rar!) and suddenly i'm back feeling like i can dial it in again. now what was that other funny word? it really had my number...i usually have to think of it eight times in a row before i feel like myself again... this is clearly referencing our encrypted .rar file we found previously and solves our dead end on step_4e. (rawr-rar!) a sextile is an astrological term used to describe two celestial bodies that are 60 degrees apart. the symbol for this is what we commonly know as the asterisk. * this symbol can be found on any modern numpad phone on the bottom left. the reference to “feeling like i can dial it in again.” also points to phones. \"it really had my number\" leads us to the number symbol also found on a phones numpad. \"i usually have to think of it eight times in a row before i feel like myself again…\" this shows that whatever the .rar’s password is will be the same word 8 times in a row. this is a good method of stopping brute forcing of the password as the string is so long. trying ######## we see that its not the way to handle this so we move to research the number sign. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/number_sign from here we can see that another “funny word” for a number sign is octothorp. we then try the following password and unlock the .rar octothorpoctothorpoctothorpoctothorpoctothorpoctothorpoctothorpoctothorp the .rar opens and our dead end on step_4c has been cleared. now that we have opened the .rar we can move on to step_4h step_4h the contents of the .rar from step_4c are revealed! opening the .rar presents us with an image and a m4a format song file. (thebox.m4a) the image shows the symbol sigma, a rather hilarious picture of kim-jong-un, grumpy cat, psy, and a key. seeing the image of mickey on kim-jong-un and the key on the page immediately leads us to believe this will be mickey’s key which is required to complete the dead end on step_4a. during most of the convention we had been taking pictures of everything we could find. this included the backs of all of the badge variants which are as follows. badge serial_1 serial_2 direction language human 55586753 01458934 west chinese human 25348567 02933985 east chinese human 30303031 38563748 south chinese human 56456387 01924834 north chinese human 32439751 50932487 north korean human 77798753 00478041 west korean human 81303557 85345360 south korean human 05978344 85758673 east korean artist 94841634 88172253 south chinese contest 09856563 23454311 east chinese vendor 05729856 57380999 north korean speaker 31337017 34029545 south chinese goon 94841634 88172253 south chinese press 06060606 00000000 south korean the symbol for sigma is used to express the sum of a set of numbers. http://mathlesstraveled.com/appendices/sigma-notation/ from the images of psy and kim-jong-un we can guess that this most likely means the sum of north korea and south korea seperately with some kind of operation in-between. pulling our previously obtained badge information we get the following relevant sets of information. vendor 05729856 57380999 north korean human 32439751 50932487 north korean press 06060606 00000000 south korean human 81303557 85345360 south korean summing the numbers ends in the following values. north 05729856+57380999+32439751+50932487 146483093 south 06060606+00000000+81303557+85345360 172709523 grumpy cat in the picture refers to concatenation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concatenation this will take our values and concatenate them as follows. 146483093172709523 with that in mind we can now solve our dead end from step_4a defcon.org/1057/nato + mickey’s key defcon.org/1057/nato146483093172709523 with our newfound url in hand we can continue to step_5 step_5 going to the url from step_4h http://defcon.org/1057/nato146483093172709523/ page source: step_5_source.txt (pastebin) picture of the page. this page contains an image and a gif. the language displayed is called ogham which was used between the 4th and 9th century. while the origin is uncertain we do know how to translate it roughly as it uses a system much like the alphabet but with 25 letters. the provided image translates to the following block. i oft correct ngour grammer or tell ngou to nee a ngnngchiarinf but the filen assisitng to ngierce the lafd that crafen fent ungof might lead ngou to dincoer the fame os the moof at coden that are curioun this needs to be decoded further to make any kind of sense. we accomplished this using the following key. ng y n s f ��n this gives us a slightly more readable message. i oft correct your grammer or tell you to see a ysychiarisf but the niles assisitng to yierce the lafd that cranes nest uyon might lead you to dincoer the name os the moon at codes that are curious from here we eyeballed it and performed changes to transform them into proper words. i oft correct your grammer or tell you to see a psychiarist but the niles affinity to pierce the land that cranes nest upon might lead you to discover the name of the moon at codes that are curious at face value this appeared to be a reference to the egyptian name of the moon. attempting this at curious.codes gave us the following url. http://curious.codes/iah however, in the source of this page we can see that it is fact a 404 message. <title>404 curious.codes</title> either we have the wrong name or we are looking in the wrong place. it turns out we were wrong on both counts. the riddle is referring to the show fraiser. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frasier this is further backed up by the name of the ogham message “scrambledeggs.jpg” which was a line from the shows opening song. the wife of niles crane is daphne moon and the actress who plays her is jane leeves. we can then take her name and, much like our previous “pussycatdolls” riddle, send it to @curious.codes janeleeves@curious.codes with our email sent and a response inbound we can now move to step 6. step_6 writing the email from step_5 we get the following response. +++ well done!

arises from annually repeated patterns of branching, elongation, thickening, and death.                                                                                                                               — brayton f. wilson, the growing tree while it’s easy enough to take the virtues of street and park trees for granted — the shade they cast, the vaulted tunnels and cathedrals they form—those giants are, generally, beloved. not so the trees of the american sprawl-spaces: strip malls and unfinished subdivisions and warehouse outskirts and truck cities. you can go years without truly seeing them, and yet there they are: the prim boxelders on the little curbed islands in the home depot parking lot. the flank of twisted shore pines along the freeway onramp. the toppled sweetgum branch pinning an arby’s bag on the median grass of the bus stop.   these forgotten or overlooked trees engage with us on multiple levels, whether we notice or not; they’re full of stories. many, obviously, were planted — planted to soften a massive hardscape, arrest fresh-bared soil, comply with municipal regulations. a few might be legacy trees from pre-sprawl farmland or prairie copses. others colonize the sprawl-scape via a bird’s gut or a propitious breeze. many we call “exotics,” coming of evolutionary age in some faraway place and planted here deliberately for their beauty or utility, or sprung up as opportunistic feral invaders. “native” trees in sprawl-space landscaping, though, have particular power, harmonizing with wild fellows in the city hinterland. winter storms in the pacific northwest set shopping mall douglas firs swaying in remote concert with free-growing ones in the backdrop foothills. royal palms squaring off miami gas stations call to mind those lording in a magnificent supercanopy over jungle hammocks a few dozen miles away. these biological kinships give some sense of continuity to sprawl, otherwise so unapologetically out-of-place. however manicured they are, sprawl-scape trees always seem a bit lonesome — reflecting, i guess, the inherent lonesomeness of their surroundings. the shadow the red maple casts all night in the glare of a warehouse security light, the same glow that fools the tree into delayed displays of autumn foliage. heavy spring rain lingers on the row of scots pines at the rest stop, their needle sprays glistening and dancing against the chrome bloodstream of the interstate. the cabbage palm edging the mcdonald’s drive-thru, has tarnished fans and rugged bootjacks daily blasted with exhaust. palm

{"url":"http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html","title":"Butterick’s Practical Typography","text":" typography in ten minutes this is a bold claim, but i stand behind it: if you learn and follow these five typography rules, you will be a better typographer than 95% of professional writers and 70% of professional designers. (the rest of this book will raise you to the 99th percentile in both categories.) all it takes is ten minutes—five minutes to read these rules once, then five minutes to read them again. note to new visitors : this book isn’t supported by banner ads. it’s supported by readers like you. if you find this tutorial valuable, see how to pay for this book. and of course, don’t overlook the other material—see the table of contents . ready? go. the typographic quality of your document is determined largely by how the body text looks. why? because there’s more body text than anything else. so start every project by making the body text look good, then worry about the rest. in turn, the appearance of the body text is determined primarily by these four typographic choices: point size is the size of the letters. in print, the most comfortable range for body text is 10–12 point . on the web, the range is 15–25 pixels . not every font appears equally large at a given point size, so be prepared to adjust as necessary. line spacing is the vertical distance between lines. it should be 120–145% of the point size. in word processors, use the “exact” line-spacing option to achieve this. the default single-line option is too tight; the 1½-line option is too loose. in css, use line-height . line length is the horizontal width of the text block. line length should be an average of 45–90 characters per line (use your word-count function) or 2–3 lowercase alphabets , like so: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd in a printed document, this usually means page margins larger than the traditional one inch. on a web page, it usually means not allowing the text to flow to the edges of the browser window. and finally, font choice. the fastest, easiest, and most visible improvement you can make to your typography is to ignore the fonts that came free with your computer (known as system fonts ) and buy a professional font (like my fonts equity and concourse , or others found in font recommendations ). a professional font gives you the benefit of a professional designer’s skills without having to hire one. if that’s impossible, you can still make good typography with system fonts. but choose wisely. and never choose times new roman or arial, as those fonts are favored only by the apathetic and sloppy. not by typographers. not by you. that’s it. as you put these five rules to work, you’ll notice your documents starting to look more like professionally published material. then, if you’re ready for a little more, try the summary of key rules . if you’re ready for a lot more, start at the foreword and keep reading. top summary of key rules  → ","createdAt":1412789323702,"_id":"gt57qO4ckM1Ib9KF"}

professor raffaello d'andrea at the institute for dynamic systems and control, eth zürich (switzerland). his research lies in the field of algorithms for the control of aerial vehicles, with a specific focus on exploiting the exceptional agility of the quadrotor vehicles that are used in the flying machine arena . he is interested in understanding the physical limits of how quickly these vehicles can move, real-time trajectory generation algorithms that get close to these physical limits, the use of learning control methods to improve flight performance, and complex tasks that rely on the vehicle's agility (such as balancing an inverted pendulum on a quadrocopter). he also contributed to the flight assembled architecture project, for which he developed task-specific trajectory generation algorithms based on his previous work, worked on the robustness of the estimation algorithms to measurement data blackouts, and assisted with the implementation of a space reservation system that he had previously developed with luzius brodbeck . markus studied mechatronics at tu darmstadt (germany) and eth zürich (switzerland) from 2003 to 2009, receiving a scholarship from robert bosch gmbh for his graduate studies. he has worked on optimizing the operating strategy of diesel engines to reduce emissions and fuel consumption with professor lino guzzella (as outlined in this paper ), on the characterization of component load profiles for axle-split hybrid vehicle drivetrains at robert bosch gmbh (a system that has now been commercialized in the peugeot 3008 hybrid4 ), and on the performance development of v8 formula one racing engines at mercedes-benz highperformanceengines (evolutions of these engines powered the 2008 and 2009 formula one world drivers' champions ). research: optimality-based quadrotor flight maneuvers in the hands of a skilled pilot, a quadrocopter is an exceptionally agile flying machine. but what are the physical limits of their maneuverability, and how could these be attained in autonomous flight? the dynamics of quadrocopters during rapid maneuvers are too complex for traditional control systems to cope with. while conventional control design techniques (e.g. pid control) allow the stable flight of quadrocopters, the flight performance is relatively low compared to the inherent capabilities of these vehicles. this is because strong assumptions are required to design the controllers: typical designs are based on a simplified description of the system behavior (linearized models). while this is satisfactory at hover and low velocities, the descriptions do not correctly predict system behavior during fast maneuvers. in fact, most controllers are specifically designed for low velocities. this research focuses on reducing the gap between autonomous flight performance and inherent capabilities of quadrocopters through novel control techniques for quadrotor flight controls. this should drastically increase the flight performance of quadrocopters while still providing stability. the research is carried out in the flying machine arena and considers several aspects: physical maneuverability limits time-optimal maneuvers provide an absolute reference point that all other flight maneuvers can be compared to: they provide a lower bound on how quickly the quadrocopter vehicle is able to complete a maneuver based on its physical properties. this lower bound may then be used to benchmark the performance of other control strategies in order to determine their relative merits. a tool has been developed in order to compute time-optimal two-dimensional maneuvers with arbitrary initial and final states [1]. besides the possibility to benchmark other controllers, the tool also permits the evaluation of performance implications of quadrotor design parameters. for example, the effect of installing a larger or smaller battery can be quantified. the computed time-optimal maneuvers have also been verified experimentally: browsers supported: netscape 7.* and higher, ie 5.x and higher, mozilla 1.x and higher while time-optimal maneuvers are a helpful tool when designing vehicles and controllers, the computational effort required to find them is too high to deploy such tools to guide quadrocopters in situations where the vehicle must be able to react to disturbances and a changing environment. real-time trajectory generation and control when facing dynamic environments, changing objectives, or disturbances, the time available to plan and execute a maneuver does not suffice to compute time-optimal maneuvers. it is therefore necessary to find ways to simplify the maneuver computation on the fly. these simplified maneuvers should sacrifice as little as possible of the achievable performance. a real-time trajectory generation algorithm, allowing the computation of trajectories from arbitrary initial states to a target position, has been presented [2]. this algorithm relies on approximations of the real quadrotor flight dynamics in order to simplify the trajectory generation problem. using optimality conditions for the simplified model, it is possible to compute fast flight maneuvers at sub-millisecond computation times. with the computation of flight maneuvers requiring significantly less than one millisecond, it becomes possible to dynamically react to disturbances or changing environments: when the vehicle deviates from its planned path, or when the objective changes, these changes can be incorporated in a new maneuver almost instantaneously. for example, it is possible to intercept a moving object (such as a ball) mid-air by continuously re-planning the maneuver as the vehicle moves and measurements of the ball flight path become available [3]: browsers supported: netscape 7.* and higher, ie 5.x and higher, mozilla 1.x and higher this trajectory generation algorithm was also used in the flight assembled architecture project , where the ability to efficiently compute trajectories was leveraged in order to plan flight paths and coordinate multiple vehicles through a space reservation system: browsers supported: netscape 7.* and higher, ie 5.x and higher, mozilla 1.x and higher optimality-based task controller design in addition to the design of maneuvers for quadrotors in free flight, tasks involving the interaction of the vehicles with other objects and each other are investigated. the design of maneuvers and feedback control laws is based on a model-based approach and optimality conditions. a control system permitting an inverted pendulum to be balanced on top of a quadrocopter has been designed [4]. besides stabilizing the pendulum at hover, the system is also able to fly on circular trajectories, and follow set point changes: browsers supported: netscape 7.* and higher, ie 5.x and higher, mozilla 1.x and higher in a further experimental setup, three quadrocopters are connected by a net and elastic strings. using bang-bang and optimal control principles, trajectories and feedback control laws are designed for the fleet of quadrocopters [5]. these allow the system to toss a ball from the net into the air by rapidly stretching out the net, and then catch it again by executing a maneuver to the predicted impact point: browsers supported: netscape 7.* and higher, ie 5.x and higher, mozilla 1.x and higher learning-based performance improvement even without external disturbances (such as wind gusts), the maneuver design and feedback control strategies presented above will not be able to achieve the full performance potential. one of the reasons for this is that typical control designs are fundamentally reactive: the maneuvers are planned based on mathematical models of the quadrocopter. in reality, however, the vehicle does not react exactly as predicted by these models. this leads to errors when executing a planned maneuver. these errors are measured, and an appropriate reaction is executed when a deviation from the desired maneuver is observed. in order to prevent these errors from happening in the first place, the reactive control designs are augmented by a proactive component: when executing a maneuver repeatedly, it is possible to use knowledge from previous executions and a model to derive how repeated errors can be avoided. the research focus of this aspect is the efficient computation of such corrections for maneuvers. browsers supported: netscape 7.* and higher, ie 5.x and higher, mozilla 1.x and higher putting it all together the combination of real-time trajectory generation, optimality-based task controllers, and learning algorithms permits a dramatic performance improvement in quadrotor flight, enabling the execution of complex, precise, high-performance tasks. an experimental demonstration of such a task is the balancing, throwing, and catching of an inverted pendulum by quadrocopters [6]: browsers supported: netscape 7.* and higher, ie 5.x and

in fixed point integer arithmetic it appears that this must be rounded off. but that causes a huge problem, since it loses a great deal of information. enter floating point . this represents numbers as where is a fixed point number and so is . now is equal to . great—no loss in accuracy. but what is ? now we can represent this approximately, but not exactly. this is both the strength and the difficulty of floating point numbers. the fact that numbers are only approximations yields many interesting questions about how to manage computations to minimize the loss of accuracy. it is interesting, to me, that very early computers used hardware to implement floating point type systems. the z3 of konrad zuse used them, and also implemented the square root operation in hardware. this machine was electromechanical: the sum problem a fundamental problem is that there can be rounding—see this item als from dr. dobbs’ for this example: but of course this shows that addition with rounding is not associative. it also shows that while the two answers are different and they are close in a relative sense. one might think that this is okay, and it can be in many situations. if the computation was computing the difference between two known to be huge numbers, then the fact that the answer was zero or almost zero might be insignificant. but there are other examples where this is just plain wrong and could cause a program to fail. in any event, the failure of the associative law may at least make debugging and understanding a program much more difficult. this is probably why von neumann was against floating point: it can be hard to debug and test. thus, the main question is can we do better? the answer is yes. solutions let’s make the problem into a clean formal problem: given a list of floating point numbers, what is the best way to get so that is as small as possible? the above example shows that the trivial algorithm of adding up the numbers in order is definitely not the optimal way. this suggests that we use some kind of cleverness in either reordering the numbers or in keeping track of additional information. of course, since this is such a basic problem, we want our algorithm to operate in time close to linear time—we want the number of basic operations to stay close to . the state of the art is that there are algorithms that compute good answers to the sum problem. some trade running time for accuracy. one of the simplest uses sorting to rearrange the numbers. kahan himself developed an algorithm that achieves error growth that is bounded independent of : it does dependent on a kind of condition number that describes how well behaved the sum is. another nice algorithm uses divide and conquer: one recursively divides the set of numbers into two halves, sums each half, and then adds the two sums. this has the advantage of requiring the same number of arithmetic operations as the naive summation (unlike kahan’s algorithm, which requires four times the arithmetic and has a latency of four times a simple summation) and can be calculated in parallel. the base case of the recursion could in principle be the sum of only one (or zero) numbers, but to amortize the overhead of recursion one would normally use a larger base case. the equivalent of pairwise summation is used in many fast fourier transform (fft) algorithms, and is responsible for the logarithmic growth of roundoff errors in those ffts. in practice, with roundoff errors of random signs, the root mean square errors of pairwise summation actually grow as can one be perfect? james demmel and yozo hida proved several interesting further results in a cool paper in 2002. one is that under reasonable assumptions they get the summation exactly when the answer is zero. this is a quite interesting property for those of us in theory. it suggests a definition: let be the set of finite precision numbers allowed. let map to —note is a function defined over the reals. let be an algorithm that implements . say that this algorithm is perfect provided for any in , if is in , then . thus, if the answer can be represented in , the algorithm always gives exactly that. this is a strong property of an algorithm: if the answer is possible, then the algorithm does indeed get it. the algorithm by demmel and hida achieves this for the special case of summation for the special value . for other final values, however, it can be off by one-plus in the least designated significant unit. their algorithm also requires that the number of values being summed is bounded in terms of the available precision and the significance requirement; if exceeds the bound then the algorithm can be thrown off wildly. this indicates the surprising delicacy of the kind of simple matter that programmers might take for granted. one idea i had is to run the fixed-point parts of the calculations modulo for several large primes . errors modulo different values of might be combined to reduce the overall error, or at least provide a guarantee. open problems what is the cost of making an algorithm perfect? what happens for more general type arithmetic computations? are there similar methods that reduce the error, yet keep the computation cost about the same?
